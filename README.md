# Chess
An implementation of a two player chess game in C++

To play, first compile chess.cpp, then run it from terminal.

I started writing this as an example to remind my brother of some C++ syntax, 
but then I decided I might as well finish it.  There are still a few kinks though.
I haven't programmed the promotion of pawns when they reach the other side of the board.
You can't perform any "strange moves" like "Castling"
